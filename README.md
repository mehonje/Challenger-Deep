# Challenger-Deep
This is my first proper game, using my own game engine.

It uses my custom Python game engine, https://github.com/mehonje/Mehonje-s-Game-Engine

This is a Python version of my Challenger Deep Game on Scratch, https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1173178405/

Instructions
  W and S to move
  Left and right to rotate the light
  Up and down to change the light's brightness

Notes and Credits
  Made for World Ocean Day 2025, on June 8.

  Getting to the bottom requires 2:30 to 5 hours or 1:45 to 3:15 hours, depending on the submersible you get. Good luck!
