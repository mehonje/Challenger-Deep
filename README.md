This is my first proper game, with goals and things to pull people in, unlike the Depths, which was really a game engine.

Instructions
  Double click the green flag!
  
  W and S to move Left and right to rotate the light
  Up and down to change the light's brightness
  Press E to open the pause menu, change the sound effect and music volume, and save and load
  
  This game takes a little while to play. It can take anywhere from 1 to 3 hours, depending on the choice of submersible you make. DSV Limiting Factor is the slower of the two, while the Deepsea Challenger is the fastest.
  Get to the bottom of the Challenger Deep, the deepest point of the ocean, in the Mariana Trench. Your username will be added to a list of winners and seen at the bottom!
  
  Hover in the top right to see the fps, y position, speed, time you've played (hopefully a while!), and the tick timer

  Made for World Ocean Day, June 8, 2025.

  Getting to the bottom requires one to one and a half hours. Good luck!
